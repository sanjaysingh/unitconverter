# Unit Converter

A simple web-based unit converter that actually works and looks decent! ðŸŽ¯

## What it does

Convert between different units for:
- **Length** - inches, feet, meters, kilometers, etc.
- **Weight** - pounds, kilograms, ounces, grams
- **Temperature** - Fahrenheit â†” Celsius 
- **Area** - square meters, acres, hectares, etc.
- **Timestamps** - Unix timestamps â†” human-readable dates

## Features

- Works on mobile and desktop
- Converts as you type (no buttons to click)
- Remembers your settings in the URL
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Built with Vue.js for smooth interactions

## How to use

Just open `index.html` in your browser and start converting! Pick a category, enter a value, and watch the magic happen.

## Files

- `index.html` - The main page
- `app.js` - All the Vue.js logic
- `styles.css` - Custom styles (though mostly using Tailwind)

That's it! No build steps, no dependencies to install. Just good old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
